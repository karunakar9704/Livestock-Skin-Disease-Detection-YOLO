# Livestock-Skin-Disease-Detection-YOLO
AI-based livestock skin disease detection using YOLO. The system analyzes animal skin images to automatically detect and classify diseases like mange, ringworm, hotspot, and flea allergy, enabling early diagnosis, better treatment, and improved livestock health.
Skin diseases in livestock are a major challenge in animal farming as they affect animal health, productivity, and farmers’ income. Early and accurate detection is essential to prevent disease spread and minimize losses, but traditional diagnostic methods are often manual, time-consuming, and dependent on expert veterinarians.
This project presents an AI-based approach for automated detection of livestock skin diseases using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. By analyzing images of animal skin, the system can accurately identify and classify diseases such as mange, ringworm, hotspot, and flea allergy. The model leverages deep learning and convolutional neural networks to learn complex visual features like texture, color, and lesion patterns.
The proposed system offers fast, reliable, and scalable disease detection with minimal computational requirements. It supports early diagnosis and timely treatment, reducing human error and improving overall livestock health. This solution aims to assist farmers and veterinary professionals, especially in rural areas, and contributes to sustainable and smart animal husbandry practices.
